# TDDD27 Project Spotify Quiz


## Prject description

To make a music quiz to enjoy your time with your friends.

## Functional req.

The user should be able to search for songs to create playlists with their friends. The songs should be gathered from spotify using a simple search bar. The users should select the songs from a group of options, and the choices should not be visible to the other players. 
There are three fields, one is song title, singer, and the user who added the song into the playlist. Each correct answer gets one point, and if a user gets all three correct, they will get one extra point.

People could add other users as friends by userID, and can easily see if their friends are online. Users have to create an account to be able to play as that is required by the spotify API. The player should be able to see data about their account visualized, with things such as total number of friends online, score/game over time and similar.
